## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a modern microservices architecture:

1. **Data Collection Service** (`proxy.py`):
   - Implements rate limiting for API compliance
   - Processes and transforms raw flight data
   - Uses asyncio for non-blocking operations

2. **Database Layer** (InfluxDB):
   - Optimized for time-series data
   - Efficient data compression
   - Built-in data retention policies
   - Secure token-based authentication

3. **Visualization Layer** (Grafana):
   - Custom-designed dashboards
   - Real-time data updates
   - Interactive filtering and exploration
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

## üí° Technical Highlights

This project showcases several advanced software engineering practices:

- **Efficient Data Collection**: Implements smart rate limiting to maintain API compliance while maximizing data collection
- **Scalable Architecture**: Containerized services can be easily scaled or modified
- **Security First**: Secure credentials management using Docker secrets
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete environment defined in Docker Compose
- **Single Command Deployment**: Simple setup process requiring minimal configuration
